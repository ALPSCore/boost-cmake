### cmake scripts for boost compilation

Here's a CMake script, that allows (now only statically) to compile and install boost libraries from the given directory with boost sources (has to be specified with *Boost_ROOT_DIR*). 

##### Usage
`cmake -DBoost_ROOT_DIR=/Users/antipov/code/boost_src/boost_svn _path_to_boost-cmake_dir`
